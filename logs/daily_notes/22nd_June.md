# 🗓️ Day 08 – 22nd June 2025
## 🎯 Objectives:
- Implement SHAP Global Interpretability
- Polish the Streamlit UI
- Verify full Docker-based deployment

---

## ✅ What Was Done:

1. **SHAP Global Interpretability (TreeExplainer):**
   - Loaded the final `tree_model_tuned.pkl`.
   - Computed SHAP values using `TreeExplainer`.
   - Generated `beeswarm` plot successfully after fixing class selection + matrix mismatch.
   - Saved global explanation in `models/shap_summary_tree.png`.

2. **Streamlit UI Polishing:**
   - Added descriptive headings, icons, and color contrast for better UX.
   - Clear segregation between input form and prediction.
   - Added explanation section for SHAP interpretation.

3. **Docker Deployment Fixes:**
   - Moved `Dockerfile` to project root to fix `COPY ../` context error.
   - Updated Dockerfile paths to relative (no `../`).
   - Ensured `shap` added to `requirements.txt`.
   - Resolved `CMD` to use:
     ```dockerfile
     CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app/credit_scoring_app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
     ```

4. **Deployment Test:**
   - Verified successful Docker image build and container run.
   - Confirmed the app was accessible at `http://localhost:8501/`.

## ❗ Issues Faced:
- SHAP shape mismatch (`DimensionError`, `ValueError`) due to incorrect matrix indexing.
- Docker COPY failures due to referencing paths outside build context.
- Streamlit couldn’t find `shap` → missing in `requirements.txt`.
